                <h3 class="margin-top-10">week 1 <span class="light-grey">|</span> data</h3>

                <p>When you're saying "music in December" to somebody from the Netherlands, there's a very likely chance that they'll think of the <a href="http://www.nporadio2.nl/top2000" target="_new">Top 2000</a>. A yearly chosen list of songs that is played between Christmas and midnight December 31st. I've actually played with this data before. It was perhaps <a href="http://nbremer.github.io/top2000/" target="_new">my 2nd serious personal project</a> and I was still very new to d3. Since I sometimes see artists revisiting artwork they've done in the past to see how their style evolved (which I always love to see), I thought it would be fitting to try and to the same myself (in the sketch section you'll see I've had this idea for a few months already). So, 2 years since my previous attempt, I'm going to look at the Top 2000 again and visualize the insights.</p>

                <p>Not to worry if you're not Dutch, the Top 2000 is probably 90% English songs, with Queen often on 1st place, and many Beatles, U2 and Michael Jackson songs, so the list should seem familiar to most of you.</p>

                <p>The Top 2000 thankfully shares an Excel file of the 2000 songs containing the name, artist and year of release. This year it was released on December 19th. However, I needed another important variable; the highest rank ever reached in the normal weekly charts. There are a few of these in the Netherlands, but I chose to go with the Top 40, since this has been going non-stop since 1965. But also because the Top 40 website seemed scrape-able. So I wrote a small scraper that would go through 50 years of charts lists and save the artist's name, song title, URL to the song's page and position. This data was then aggregated to make it unique per song (the URL of the song was the unique key) and save some extra info, such as the highest position ever reached and number of weeks in the Top 40.</p> 

                <p>Next came the tricky bit, matching those artists and songs to those in the Top 2000 list. Of course I first tried a merge on an exact match of artist and title. That connected about 60% of the songs. Browsing through the remaining songs I saw that sometimes one of the two lists was using more words than the other, such as <i>John Lennon-Plastic Ono Band</i> versus just <i>John Lennon</i>. So I also searched for partial matches between the lists, as long as all the words of one song and artist were contained in the other list. That helped match 10% more.</p>

                <p>Then came the fuzzy part. Sometimes words are written slightly different, such as <i>Don't stop 'til you get enough</i> versus <i>Don't stop 'till you get enough</i>. Using R's <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringdist/index.html" target="_new">stringdist</a> package, I applied the "Full Damerau-Levenshtein" distance to compare titles and artists (it counts the number of deletions, insertions, substitutions, and transposition of adjacent characters necessary to turn b into a). However, I was quite strict and said that only 2 changes are allowed on both the title and artist to create a match (otherwise the song <i>Bad</i> from <i>U2</i> could be turned into any other 3-letter song and 2-3 letter artist). Sadly, that only gave me 2.5% more matches. As a side note, I did have to quickly check all the matched songs after each step to take out wrong matches.</p>

                <p>Almost 600 songs were still not matched. However, that's is not necessarily a bad thing, since not all songs made the Top 40. Number 3, <i>Led Zeppelin</i> with <i>Stairway to Heaven</i> for example! But how to know which "unmatched" songs were meant to be unmatched, and which songs had actually appeared in the Top 40, but had failed to match? One final idea I applied had to do with the <a href="https://www.top40.nl/tipparade/2016/week-50" target="_new">Tips of the week</a>. Since ±1970 the music station airing the Top 40 also keeps a list of 20/30 tips; songs that aren't in the Top 40, but that the DJ's think will / should be. I therefore scraped that list as well for all available years and performed exactly the same steps as with the Top 40 list. This gave me 8% more matched songs for which I new for certain that they were never in the Top 40 (but they were tipped once).</p>

                <p>For the remaining ±430 songs I just manually went through the list to look at artists or song titles that have long or odd names for which I thought the matching probably didn't work and therefore could be a Top 40 song, such as <i>Andrea Bocelli & Sarah Brightman</i> in the Top 2000 list versus <i>Sarah Brightman & Andrea Bocelli</i> in the Top 40. I still can't say for the remaining 380 songs how many of those did actually appear in the Top 40, but to be honest, after all the data processing and things I've learned and checked about the data along the way, I think it's less than 10%.</p>

                <h3>week 2 <span class="light-grey">|</span> sketches</h3>

                <p>This spring I was in <a href="https://twitter.com/juanvelasco" target="_new">Juan Velasco's</a> excellent workshop <a href="http://graphichunters.nl/information-graphics-for-print-and-online/", target="_new">Information Graphics for Print and Online</a>. Part of the workshop was to work out an infographic. And although my small team of 3 had written down about 40 possible ideas we were all intrigued by the Top 2000 songs. From experience with my previous attempt of visualizing this data I already knew that there was a very interesting shift happening in the most loved decade (of release) over the past years (the Top 2000 started in 1999). Therefore, we choose to make that the general concept around which to base the different parts of the poster.</p>
                <p>The most recent list of 2000 songs would take center stage, visualized with a Beeswarm plot idea which would group them around their year of release. Each circle (i.e. a song) would be sized according to their highest position in the Top 40 and colored according to their rank in the Top 2000. Some of these songs would then be highlighted with annotations, such as highest newcomer.</p>
                <a class="fancybox" href="sketches/nadieh/Top_2000_Poster_idea.jpg"> <img src="sketches/nadieh/Top_2000_Poster_idea_small.jpg" class="img-responsive img-month" alt="The general idea for the Top 2000 poster"></a>

                <p>Finally, in the bottom section there would be a few mini charts that would highlight the distribution of the chosen songs on year of release between the 1999, 2008 & 2016 editions of the Top 2000. This would highlight the fact that in 1999 the bulk of the songs were released in the 70's, but that this has slowly been moving to newer decades.</p>

                <p>On the 2nd day of the workshop we also made a mobile version of this concept. This time resulting in a long scrollable Beeswarm plot where you could theoretically listen to bits of each song and see extra information.</p>

                <p>Although I won't have time to build the mobile version I still wanted to show our concept ^_^</p>

                <h3>week 3 & 4 <span class="light-grey">|</span> code</h3>

                <p>So! This month I'm finally going to make a static poster, no interactive this time. Nevertheless, I'm still going to use d3 to build the center piece (the Beeswarm). Afterwards I'll pull it into Illustrator. The smaller density plots at the bottom I'll take straight from R into Illustrator, so a whole combination of tools :)</p>
