					<p class="bold-start">More than 5000 Olympic events have had a winner, rewarded with a gold medal from 1904 onwards, in the Summer Olympics since the first games of 1896. Investigate the visuals below to see how each of these medals has been won in the 56 different sporting disciplines that have competed at the games, of which 41 are still held at Rio 2016.</p>
					<p>Most of the Olympic sports started out being a men only event. Thankfully this started to change during the 2nd half of the last century. Even the number of medals that can be won for one discipline is slowly becoming the same for both genders. Today at Rio there are 3 disciplines left in which only one gender can compete; the Greco-Roman wrestling, already at the games since the very first edition, is done solely by men. Rhythmic gymnastics & synchronized swimming on the other hand, both at the Olympics since 1984, are only performed by women.</p>

					<p>The fight info was taken from the Dragonball Wikia pages for each saga. For relevance, a few fights were taken out of the above visual; the <i>Garlic Jr.</i> and <i>Other World Tournament</i> filler sagas were completely removed. Also the ±5 fights that happened in the anime only <i>and</i> didn't feature any of the Z fighters, happened in a nightmare or flashback were taken out.</p>
