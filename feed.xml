			<p>With the Obama's leaving the white house soon Shirley investigated the emotions displayed in their tv-appearances to give the elections a bit of fun. In Europe, on the other hand, a presidential family is more equivalent to the Royal houses. Therefore, Nadieh investigated the family trees and how connected the current royal leaders really are.

			<p>Another month with a personal angle. Since we both like to travel and see the world we wanted to dive into our past vacations. Nadieh digged up as much information as she could about every vacation that she's ever been on since birth. Shirley focused on the colors in the photos taken in the last few years.

			<p>With both of us Olympics fans we couldn't have any other topic this month. Shirley focused on creating an artful representation of the diving routines, while Nadieh visualized all 5000 gold medal winners of the summer editions since the very first Olympic Games in 1896.

			<p>For our very first month we looked into movies that have a personal connection to us. For Nadieh that turned out to be a deep dive into the number of words spoken in all 3 extended editions of the Lord of the Rings. Shirley looked into the top summer movies since the year of her birth. Read more about the exact data + sketch + code that we performed in our write-up...</p>]]></description>
